                I made a small cabin using only paper and glue. The cabin is white and brown, giving it a cozy and rustic look. I used folding and cutting techniques to create the walls and roof. The white color makes it look clean, while the brown gives it a warm, natural feel. The hardest part was making sure the paper stayed glued together, but I made sure everything was secure. The cabin looks simple, but it took a lot of care to put it together.

                In my Interior Design class, I created a color wheel and learned how colors work together in a space. I discovered the primary colors—red, blue, and yellow—and how they mix to make secondary colors like green, orange, and purple.

              <p class="project-text">
                I also learned about hue, tint, tone, and shade. These helped me understand how designers use light and dark colors to create different moods in a room. This project was fun and helped me see how important color is in interior design.

                As part of my Interior Design class, I drew a bedroom using two-point perspective. This technique helped me make the room look more realistic by showing depth and angles. It was a great way to practice how to draw spaces that look 3D.

                For one of my projects, I designed a living room using a monochromatic green color scheme. I used different shades, tints, and tones of green to create a calm and stylish space. This project taught me how using just one color in different ways can still make a room look interesting and balanced.

                In this project, I designed a bedroom using a monochromatic yellow color scheme. I used light and dark shades of yellow to give the room warmth and brightness. This activity helped me see how one color can create a cozy and unified look when used in different ways.

                For my project, I designed an office using complementary colors—orange and blue. These two colors sit opposite each other on the color wheel, which makes the space lively and balanced. Using complementary colors helped me understand how contrast can make a room feel energetic and visually appealing.
