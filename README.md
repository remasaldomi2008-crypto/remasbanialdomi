# Remas Portfolio (GitHub Pages Template)

This is a clean, fast portfolio template (no frameworks) designed for university admissions review: simple navigation, strong typography, and curated galleries with a slideshow/lightbox.

## 1) Create a GitHub account using your daughter’s email
- Sign up on GitHub with her email.
- Choose a username (example: `remas-portfolio`).
- Turn on 2-factor authentication (recommended).

## 2) Create the website repository
- Create a new repository named exactly: **USERNAME.github.io**
  - Example: `remasbanialdomi.github.io`
- Make it public (GitHub Pages works best public).
- Upload these files (everything in this folder).

## 3) Turn on GitHub Pages
- Repository → **Settings** → **Pages**
- Source: **Deploy from a branch**
- Branch: **main** / folder: **/(root)**
- Save → Your site will be live at: `https://USERNAME.github.io/`

## 4) Replace the sample images
Put images into:
- `assets/images/photography/`
- `assets/images/drawings/`
- `assets/images/minecraft/`

Then open:
- `photography.html`
- `drawings.html`
- `minecraft.html`

…and replace the `images = [...]` list with your real files + captions.

### Caption tips (fast + impressive)
Use 1–2 lines:
- what it is
- what skill it shows
- what you improved

Example:
> “Lake reflections at dusk — practiced exposure control and composition using leading lines.”

## 5) Add the resume PDF (optional)
Compile the resume as PDF and place it here:
- `assets/files/Remas_Resume.pdf`

## 6) Privacy checklist (important)
For a public portfolio, avoid:
- date of birth
- phone number (optional)
- full home address
- school ID numbers

Use: city/state, a portfolio email, and (optional) a contact form.

## Want me to make it fully customized?
If you upload Remas’s real folders (photos/drawings/minecraft screenshots) as a zip, I can:
- organize galleries (best-first)
- write captions
- add a “Projects & Service” page
- embed a polished resume page + PDF link
- export the final site as a ready-to-upload zip
